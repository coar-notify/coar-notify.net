Changed the example patterns to be more specific. They now (mostly) mention specific types of system actor, etc. instead of being completely generic. With a few specific exceptions (listed below under *Exceptional Changes*), the properties used have not changed significantly, nor the patterns themselves. In most cases only the example entities mentioned in the properties have changed.

This means that there is no change to the relationship between the example scenarios and the patterns, or to the scenarios themselves.

Part of the reasoning for this is to build a relationship between the (slightly more specific) _Notify_ patterns, and the (more generic) patterns specified in _[Event Notifications in Value-Adding Networks](https://www.eventnotifications.net)_.

#### Exceptional Changes to Patterns
* The [Rescinding an Offer](/patterns/undo-offer/) pattern has had the `context` property removed
* A `context` property has been added to the [Announce Ingest](/patterns/announce-ingest/) pattern.

#### Other Changes
* The PURL used for the _COAR Notify Vocabulary_ - `https://purl.org/coar/notify_vocabulary/` - now uses HTTPS instead of HTTP. However the HTTP form will continue to resolve correctly.
