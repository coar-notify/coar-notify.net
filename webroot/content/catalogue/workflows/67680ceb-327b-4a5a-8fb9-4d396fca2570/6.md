PCI proceeds with evaluation of the preprint until an editorial decision is reached. The authors are emailed to inform them of the decision and to share the reviews with them.
   
If the editorial decision is to endorse the preprint, then the outcome is published on the PCI site.

In the editorial decision is that a revision is required, then the author is emailed to explain that resubmission will have to be made through the repository (as before)
