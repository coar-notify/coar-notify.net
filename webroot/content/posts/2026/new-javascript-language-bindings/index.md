We are pleased to announce the release of new Javascript language bindings for COAR Notify. These bindings allow developers to more easily integrate COAR Notify into their web applications using Javascript.

This complements the previously released Python, Ruby and PHP bindings, providing a more comprehensive set of tools for developers working in different programming environments.

More details available on the [COAR Notify Code Libraries and Components](/catalogue/code-libraries/) page.
