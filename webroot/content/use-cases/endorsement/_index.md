This use case is about endorsement of repository resources, involving an endorsement service of some kind. One common example may be the publishing of repository-based resources in overlay journals, initiated either by the repository, or by the overlay journal.

## Overlay journals
In the overlay publishing model, a journal performs peer review and endorsement of an article or preprint, but it doesn’t publish articles on its website. Rather, the journal’s website links to final article versions hosted in an online repository. In some cases, the final article versions may also be mirrored on the journal website. The overlay publishing process usually involves a number of steps that can be automated using the Notify technologies.
