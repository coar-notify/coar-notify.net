title: PCI proceeds with review of the preprint
description: |
  PCI proceeds with evaluation of the preprint until an editorial decision is reached. The authors are emailed to inform them of the decision and to share the reviews with them. There are three possible outcomes:
  
  - If the editorial decision is to endorse the preprint, then the outcome is published on the PCI site and *AnnounceReview* and *AnnounceEndorsement* notifications are sent.
  - If the editorial decision is that a revision is required, then the author is emailed to explain that resubmission will have to be made through the repository (as before). A *TentativeReject* notification is sent.
  - If the editorial decision is not to endorse the preprint, then the author is emailed to inform them of the decision and a *Reject* notification is sent.
