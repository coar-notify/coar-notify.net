This workflow was originally developed by Harvard University between its publications repository and its data repository, but it can be used by other repositories or systems.

The DSpace community have documented their implementation of this workflow in *[Use Cases - Getting two DSpace application to communicate with each other](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/DSDOC8x/Use+Cases+-+Getting+two+DSpace+application+to+communicate+with+each+other)*.
