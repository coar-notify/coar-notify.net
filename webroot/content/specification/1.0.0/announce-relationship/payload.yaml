    * An `id` which contains the URI for the relationship with the target-hosted resource
    * A `type` which should describes the type of the relationship and should include a value from *Activity Streams 2.0*
    * A 'triple' describing the relationship, in the form:
      * `as:subject`: containing the URI for the local resource
      * `as:relationship`: containing a relationship URI
      * `as:object`: containing the URI for the remote resource
context:
  value:
    id: "https://another-research-organisation.org/repository/datasets/item/201203421/"

    In this example, this identifies the resource on the `target` which is the object of the relationship expressed as a "triple" in the `object`. Note that, therefore, the value of the `id` in the `context` is the same as the value of the `as:object` in the "triple".
    * MUST have an `id` which in this example is the HTTP URI of the "landing page" for the resource.
    * SHOULD have a `type` which, in the case of a repository landing page, SHOULD include the value *AboutPage* from schema.org.
    * SHOULD have an `ietf:cite-as` which SHOULD contain the persistent HTTP URI (sometimes called the "PID") which is to be used to cite or link to the resource.
    * SHOULD have an `ietf:item` containing the details of the actual content resource. The `ietf:item`:
      * MUST have an `id` containing the HTTP URI of the content file for the resource.
      * SHOULD have a `type` describing the content file.
      * SHOULD have a `mediaType` which contains the MIME Type of the content file.
