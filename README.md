## About COAR Notify
<img src="notify_logo.png" alt="COAR Notify logo" width="200"/>

The [*COAR Notify Initiative*](https://www.coar-repositories.org/notify/) is developing and accelerating community adoption of a standard, interoperable, and decentralised approach (using Linked Data Notifications) to link research outputs hosted in the distributed network of repositories with resources from external services, such as overlay-journals and open peer review services.

### Funding acknowledgement

COAR has been awarded a US$4 million grant from Arcadia, which will go towards the COAR Notify Project. The funded project began on July 1st, 2022 and will last for four years.
