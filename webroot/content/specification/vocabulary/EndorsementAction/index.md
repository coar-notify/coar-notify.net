This term also has the URI *https://purl.org/coar/notify_vocabulary/endorsement-action/* as a unique identifier. This URI is still a valid identifier, but we have deprecated the use of PURLs in favor of simply using the *coar-notify.net* domain.

We will maintain the PURL identifier for as long as we are able to access and manage this, but it should be considered **deprecated**.

The term is unchanged in meaning.
