    It is the complete payload (without the `@context` property) of the *Offer* `activity` to which this pattern is a response.
    In this case, the `object` contains an inner `object` which represents the resource which was being offered, rather than an `activity`.
    Note that the value of the `inReplyTo` property is the same as the value of the `id` property of the `object`, because both point to the original *Offer* `activity`.
