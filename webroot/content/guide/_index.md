Welcome to the COAR Notify Implementation Guide!

This Implementation guide is being actively developed to support the community of developers either considering or actively implementing [COAR Notify](https://www.coar-repositories.org/notify/). However, anyone else with an interest in the COAR Notify Initiative may also find this handbook informative.

### Components of the COAR Notify Protocol
The COAR Notify Protocol specifies:

#### Notification Patterns
_Notification Patterns_ (templates) describe the payload for re-usable notifications. These notifications describe the individual linked data notifications sent between repositories and services, one or more of which may be used in a *scenario*.

Notify notification patterns are more specific implementations of the generic patterns described by *[Event Notifications in Value-Adding Networks](https://www.eventnotifications.net/)*.

#### Vocabulary
A _Vocabulary_ is provided to give values for certain properties in the notification payloads.

#### Workflows
_Workflows_ which describe a particular set of notifications used by a service to provide a service, typically involving a repository system.

*The COAR Notify Protocol is described in detail, with examples, in [the specification section](/specification/).*
