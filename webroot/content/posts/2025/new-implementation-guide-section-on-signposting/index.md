A new section in the Implementation Guide on the use of _[Signposting](https://signposting.org/FAIR/)_ in COAR Notify, written by Patrick Hochstenbach, is [now available](https://coar-notify.net/guide/signposting/).
<!--more-->
This section explains how to implement and use Signposting in COAR Notify workflows, to automatically discover resources related to the `object` of the workflow as well as to find the LDN inbox associated with a resource. It covers the concepts and purpose behind Signposting, before giving some examples of how it might be implemented in a typical COAR Notify scenario.

The use of Signposting is strongly recommended to all who implement COAR Notify (and indeed any machine interaction with a a repository or related system).
