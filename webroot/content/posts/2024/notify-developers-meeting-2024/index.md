On the 7th and 8th March 2024 a core group of developers came together to compare their experiences with implementing COAR Notify in their systems.

We were generously hosted by Isabel Bernal of [CSIC](https://www.csic.es/es) in Madrid. In keeping with all COAR activities, a range of nationalities and domains was represented.

We discussed a range of technical issues, comparing notes on what had worked well, and what needed improvement or clarification. It was also a chance for begin to establish a community of COAR Notify developers. Judging by the level of engagement, and the conversations over dinner, I think we were successful in this!

I will write here in more detail in future posts about some of the deeper technical issues, but in the meantime here is a summary of some of the decisions and outcomes:

1. Where  COAR Notify implementation software is directly commissioned by the Notify project we will use the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit) (a "permissive") license. However, we recognise that some platforms may require a different open-source license. We will not ordinarily work with software that is not open-source and licensed accordingly.
2. We will make one immediate change to the protocol ([documented in the change-log](/changelog/2024-03-21/))
3. After this immediate change to the protocol, we will use a more managed approach to versioning, deprecating etc. - however, we do not anticipate changing versions frequently.
4. We will develop an interim catalogue (on this website) to include the following:
   - Services implementing COAR Notify
   - Specific workflows supported by each service
   - Software platforms (e.g. repository platforms) which support each workflows
   - Open-source code-bases involved in implementing or supporting COAR Notify
5. Add more content to the Implementation Guide:
   - Document options for limiting access from remote systems, with some examples and the scenarios they address.
   - Extend the [architecture](/implementation/architecture/) section to include more options, and to add more detail to the pros, cons, affordances and consequences of each option.
   - Document the pros and cons of storing notifications versus not storing them
   - Document the recommended process for handling metadata with [signposting.org](https://signposting.org) - an end-to-end process
6. Increase communications support for the developer community:
   - Investigate using GitHub Discussions for forum
   - Create a mailing list to be used only for rare, important announcements (all the developers at the meeting agreed to be subscribed to this)
7. Define a new pattern for indicating that an activity was "un-processable”

The [interim catalogue](/catalogue/) is already available (**very much a "work-in-progress"**).

It was an excellent meeting - a really good group of developers doing important work. The COAR Notify team gained some invaluable insights into the challenges associated with implementing the COAR Notify protocol. I very much hope that we can do this again, perhaps in a year's time.
