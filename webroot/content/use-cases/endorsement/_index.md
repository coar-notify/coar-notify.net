[//]: # (In the overlay publishing model, a journal performs peer review and endorsement of an article or preprint, but it doesn’t publish articles on its website. Rather, the journal’s website links to final article versions hosted in an online repository. In some cases, the final article versions may also be mirrored on the journal website. The overlay publishing process usually involves a number of steps that can be automated using the Notify technologies.)
