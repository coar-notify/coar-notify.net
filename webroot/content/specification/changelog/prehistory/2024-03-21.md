Previously, some uses of the `object` and `context` properties included a `url` property. We have replaced `url` with `ietf:item` to improve interoperability with related initiatives - notably signposting.org. The content of this sub-property is unchanged, so this is simply a change to the property name.

See the [Request Endorsement pattern](/specification/patterns/request-endorsement/) for an example of this.
