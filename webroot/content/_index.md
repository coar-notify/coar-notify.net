#### Welcome to COAR Notify!

The COAR Notify Protocol is a set of profiles, constraints and conventions around the use of W3C Linked Data Notifications (LDN) to integrate repository systems with relevant services in a distributed, resilient and web-native architecture.

On January 28, 2021, [COAR](https://www.coar-repositories.org) launched the COAR Notify Initiative. It extists to develop and accelerate community adoption of a standard, interoperable, and decentralised approach (using Linked Data Notifications) to link research outputs hosted in the distributed network of repositories with resources from external services, such as overlay-journals and open peer review services. This will enable the creation of a global, decentralised, and transparent notification infrastructure for research outputs, which will be of great value to the research community, including researchers, repository managers, and service providers.
