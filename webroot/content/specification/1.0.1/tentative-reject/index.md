title: Tentatively Reject
id: tentative-accept
description: |
  This pattern is used to acknowledge and tentatively reject a request (*Offer*). This should be interpreted to mean that the `target` does not currently intend to act on the request, but that the `target` might consider another *Offer* relating to the same resource (for example following some revision of the resource).
