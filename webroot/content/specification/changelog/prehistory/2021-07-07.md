Removed the nested `object` (causing an unnecessary 'blank node') from the `coar-notify:reviews` and `coar-notify:endorses` patterns.

So, what was expressed, for example, as:
```json
"object": {
    "coar-notify:reviews": {
      "object": {
        "id": "https://repository.org/preprint/201203/421/",
        "ietf:cite-as": "https://doi.org/10.5555/12345680"
      }
    },
```

is now expressed as:
```json
"object": {
    "coar-notify:reviews": {
        "id": "https://repository.org/preprint/201203/421/",
        "ietf:cite-as": "https://doi.org/10.5555/12345680"
    },
```
