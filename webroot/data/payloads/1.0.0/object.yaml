    This `object` describes a preprint. It:
    * MUST have an `id` which MUST be the HTTP URI of the "landing page" for the resource.
    * MUST have a `type` describing the resource, which MUST include an [Activity Streams 2.0 object type](https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#objects), and SHOULD include the value *sorg:AboutPage*.
    * SHOULD have an `ietf:cite-as` which contains the persistent HTTP URI (sometimes called the "PID") which is to be used to cite or link to the resource.
    * MUST have an `ietf:item` containing the details of the actual content resource. The `ietf:item`:
      * MUST have an `id` containing the HTTP URI of the content file for the resource.
      * MUST have a `type` describing the resource, which MUST include an [Activity Streams 2.0 object type](https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#objects), and SHOULD include a value from schema.org.
      * MUST have a `mediaType` which contains the MIME Type of the content file.
endorsement-offer:

    It is the complete payload (without the `@context` property) of the *Offer* activity to which this pattern is a response.
    In this case, the `object` contains an inner `object` which represents the resource which was being offered, rather than an activity.
    Note that the value of the `inReplyTo` property MUST be the same as the value of the `id` property of the `object`, because both point to the original *Offer* activity.
